# Compilation2Mips

**Compilation project**:

What's implemented:
- basic exercice 1 work
- constant progation optimization for Imp2Mips with:
  - basic propagation: 4+3 -> 7
  - more advanced propagation: 1 + 3 * b * 2 + 4 -> 5 + b * 6

What I plan to implement:
- finish constant propagation with Lt and booleans
-  maybe try register allocation optimization
- exercice 2
